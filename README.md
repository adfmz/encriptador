## Hi folks, <img src= "Img/Avatar Dria.jpeg" width="60" height= "68" alt = "Dria`s avatar" border-radius= 24px> 
I¬¥ve developed this "Encryption program" when I had the real experience with matrix logic, using a lot about my algorithms understanding.
hope you enjoy it.


## What can you expect :


I¬¥m going to work on an application that encrypts texts, so you can exchange secret messages with other people who knows the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" I will use are:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter"

The letter "i" is converted to "imes"

The letter "a" is converted to "ai"

The letter "o" is converted to "ober"

The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

Requirements:
- Should only work with lowercase letters
- Letters with accents or special characters should not be used
- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to the original version.

For instance:
"cat" => "caitober"
gaitober" => "cat"

The page must have fields for entering the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.
The result should be displayed on the screen.
